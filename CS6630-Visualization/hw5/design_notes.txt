Shift Chart 1
=============
This shift chart plots as a line chart the votes over the years. What happens,
is if a state (or the entire country) votes/elects a republican, then the next
point is going to be +1 and democrat is going to be -1. This will show both
yearly local and overall trends for both the states and the country as a whole.

This would do well in representing the data and showing the results because
it would show recent changes and overall trends.

Shift Chart 2
=============
This shift chart plots each state as a bar chart on who it elected in a given
year. The height of the bar chart can be scaled as a proportion to the number
of electoral votes or the population of a given state. It is also possible to
use the percentage of the votes with the population to produce a slightly more
representative chart, such that plotting a double sided bar chart where each
percentage is on each side of the chart, however this may be a little more
confusing and "busy."

By scaling by the population or electoral votes, it would help represent the
overall trend of the US by looking at the relative number of bar charts that
are either democrat or republican and their size.

This can also be used for individual states, where instead of having "states"
on the x-axis, it would be counties or districts, and the height of the bar
chart can be scaled by the population size.
